      <p>July 23 - Written By Dylan Bosch</p>
      <br />
      <h3>First Blog</h3>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        If you've somehow found yourself reading this: Welcome! I'll keep this
        entry short.<br /><br />
        I've never tried blogging before. The idea always seemed a little futile
        - who's going to read the blog of a 23 year old aspiring<br />photographer?
        There's millions of other blogs and websites to check out. But I'm
        pretty bored so I figured why not give it a shot?<br /><br />
        I don't really have a plan for what I'd like to write about; maybe my
        daily life, my journey to find a job, or maybe about my hobbies and
        <br />
        interests - who knows? I don't want to put too much planning into it,
        I'd rather it be more of a natural thing.<br /><br />
        If you made it this far I hope you'll come back and read entry #2 when
        it gets written. In the meantime, it's Saturday, it's beautiful out, and
        <br />life is pretty good. Time to tackle the day.<br /><br />
        R.I.P Kona
